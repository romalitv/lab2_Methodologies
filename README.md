# Linked List Implementation
This program implements a basic linked list data structure in Kotlin. The linked list consists of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list.

Number of my student book : 1315 , but I have done it in reverse way üòÅ

## Installation
To use this linked list implementation in your Kotlin project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the code from repository : 
2. You need to have an installed Intellij Idea IDE

3. All the configuration to start the program already saved so you don't need to configure by yourself :D

4. Just click green 'play' button to run the program

## Functionality
This linked list implementation provides the following features:

- Appending an element to the end of the linked list.
- Appending a collection of elements to the end of the linked list.
- Inserting an element at a specified index in the linked list.
- Deleting an element at a specified index in the linked list.
- Deleting all occurrences of a specific element from the linked list.
- Getting the element at a specified index in the linked list.
- Finding the index of the first occurrence of a specific element in the linked list.
- Finding the index of the last occurrence of a specific element in the linked list.
- Creating a clone of the linked list.
- Reversing the order of elements in the linked list.
- Clearing the linked list by removing all elements.
- Extending the linked list by appending elements from another linked list. 

These functionalities allow for efficient manipulation of linked lists, enabling operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements in the list. The provided methods facilitate the management and utilization of linked lists in various applications and algorithms.

Doing this project I understand how much unit tests means for software engineering in all ways. They facilitate application development and prevent disruptions when making changes to existing functions, methods, and so on.
